Lab exercises for week 2

(a) Create a function which accepts a string parameter, and returns a count of the
number of characters in that string. For example, if the string provided as an input
is “test 1” then the count returned is 6.

(b) Create a function which accepts a string parameter, and returns a count of the
number of characters in that string, excluding spaces. For example, if the string
provided as an input is “test 1” then the count returned is 5.

(c) Combine both function created in 1 and 2, into one function which accepts an
optional parameter, so character count on input string can include or exclude spaces.
